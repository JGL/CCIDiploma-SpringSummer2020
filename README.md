Golan Levin also offers a useful thought from his children's school:

> When communicating, ask yourself:
>
> - T – is it True?
> - H – is it Helpful?
> - I – is it Inspiring?
> - N – is it Necessary?
> - K – is it Kind?

## Learning Outcomes and platforms for doing so

At the end of this block (the end of term 3) you should have the following outcomes, with subheadings for methods and platforms we will use to do so. To be clear, I want you to obtain knowledge and then use that to make projects. My aim is to have every student graduate with new creative computing core knowledge and a portfolio of projects that relate that new creative computing knowledge to their chosen BA subject elsewhere at University of the Arts London (UAL).

### Unit 4 / Block 2: "Coding for Collaborative App Development"

In this unit you will develop an app concept using Apple’s iOS. This will give you both an understanding of the development process using standard development tools and introduce platform specific coding languages such as Swift. Importantly this unit will include an introduction to collaborative tools for software development and an introduction to the use of key cloud-based services for deployment and collaboration. You will also explore the ethics of software development and consider issues such as privacy and data handling. 

The aim of the unit is to expose you to the team-based nature of software development and in give you experience of development processes and platforms that are in high demand the digital creative industries. With this experience you will be able to make an informed decision about what is required to work professionally in this area and what part of the development pipeline you potentially are best suited to.

### Unit 6 / Block 2: "Creative Practice: Computational Environments"

This unit builds on the creative practice developed earlier in the course and explores scaling computational practice by developing spatial interventions. You will explore projection mapping, computer vision and sound tools to explore computational environments.

The aim of this unit is to build on your experience of using the creative computing tools and techniques you have developed to produce interactive experience and consider the potential of computational space. This process will enable you to understand better the potential of computer vision to capture multimodal user behaviours and build novel responsive environments that react to people in interesting ways. There is much demand for expertise of this kind in the digital creative industries and - documented well - the project outcomes for this unit could form a strong addition to your graduation portfolio and form part of the Institute showcase activity at the end of year. 

## Block/Term Structure

Unit 5 will be taught throughout by [Alex Fefegha](https://www.comuzi.xyz/).

The second half of term two and entirity of term 3 will be spent on Unit 4 and Unit 6.

## Weekly Structure

Monday morning: lectures and discussions
Monday afternoon: homework 
Tuesday morning: lectures and discussions
Tuesday afternoon: homework, my office hours

## Assessment

At the end of block 2 (at the end of term 3), you will be assessed individually.

Unit 4 and Unit 6 are assessed in different ways:

- Unit 4 - "Coding for Collaborative App Development" - this unit will be assessed in two ways - via multiple choice test and practical coding exam. In the multiple choice test you will be presented with a series of questions relating explicitly to course content. You must choose between up to 4 potentially correct answers per question. In the Practical Exam you will be individually asked to write a basic program to demonstrate the application of creative coding to a set problem. Each part is worth 50% of the unit mark. You will be given 1 hour to complete 20 multiple choice questions. You will be given 2 hours to complete the practical coding exam.

- Unit 6 - "Creative Practice: Computational Environments" - this unit will be assessed via the presentation of a project that you will work towards throughout the first term and half of the second. This unit is about putting skills from Units 1,3,4 and 6 (and others) to use in a project. You will be assessed on your presentation and the ‘slide deck’ from the presentation, which may contain elements you didn't present. You will be given 5 minutes to present, with 5 minutes of discussion.

## Homework Projects

In addition to the formal assessment at the end of the term, I will be setting weekly homework projects. We will discuss and work on the weekly projects on Monday and Tuesday afternoons. The weekly homework projects won't be assessed, but will be in your interest to complete.

Remember that small, short, technical exercises can be the root of much bigger ideas and projects that could last a lifetime.
